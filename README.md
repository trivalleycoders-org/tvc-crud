# TVC-CRUD

This project is a stripped down version of trivalleycoders. It is used for writing CRUD code in the context of Members as well as developing the ManageMembers form.

## Status
- most up to date branch is 'generic'
- all other branches pending clean-up

## To Do - next
- check that formSort is working properly
- does cancel result in a ui update
- validation
  - can the variable(s) currently in local state for managing validation status be moved to redux?

- on Save, clear all validation
